Here's an implementation of the `MLPClassifierDeepResidual` class with at least four layers and residual connections. The solution involves creating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with residual connections using PyTorch.

### `models.py`
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MLPClassifierDeepResidual(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, h: int = 64, w: int = 64, num_classes: int = 6, hidden_dim: int = 128, num_layers: int = 4):
        """
        An MLP with multiple hidden layers and residual connections.

        Args:
            h: int, height of image
            w: int, width of image
            num_classes: int, number of output classes
            hidden_dim: int, size of hidden layers
            num_layers: int, number of hidden layers
        """
        super(MLPClassifierDeepResidual, self).__init__()

        input_dim = h * w * 3  # Assuming input images have 3 channels (e.g., RGB)
        
        # Store layers in ModuleList
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        # First layer with the input size
        self.layers.append(nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU()
        ))

        # Hidden layers
        for _ in range(1, num_layers - 1):
            self.layers.append(nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
                nn.ReLU()
            ))

        # Output layer
        self.layers.append(nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_classes))

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Args:
            x: tensor (b, 3, H, W) image

        Returns:
            tensor (b, num_classes) logits
        """
        # Flatten the input
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)

        for i, layer in enumerate(self.layers):
            if i > 0 and i < len(self.layers) - 1:
                # For intermediate layers, implement residual connections
                x = x + layer(x)  # residual connection
            else:
                # First and last layer (no residual)
                x = layer(x)

        return x
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Dimension**: Calculated from the input image dimensions `h`, `w`, and number of channels `3`.

2. **ModuleList**: Used to hold the layers to allow iteration over them during the forward pass.

3. **Layers**: 
   - Start with an input layer that converts the input dimension to `hidden_dim` using a `Linear` layer, followed by a `ReLU` activation.
   - Intermediate hidden layers are added with residual connectionsâ€”each layer output is added to its input before applying activation functions.
   - The output layer produces logits for the specified number of classes.

4. **Forward Pass**:
   - The input tensor `x` is flattened to a vector.
   - The loop iterates through each layer while maintaining the residual connections for the intermediate layers.
   - Sum the input and output of each intermediate layer for the residual effect.

### Note
This implementation assumes the usage of the PyTorch library, an integral part of the modern deep learning development process. To use this model, ensure that the necessary imports and packages are available. With this setup, you can directly move on to training your network using the command provided.
